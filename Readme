This is a relative sectionining package for LaTeX.
The normal LaTeX sectioning commands like \section,
\subsection and \chapter are replaced by \dynsection
whose effect depends on the use of \leveldown and
\levelup prior to the command. This makes restructuring
easier since whole passages can just be copy-and-pasted
to a new location at a different position in the
sectioning tree and just work, without having to change
all the \section etc. commands in the copied passage.

There is a \gotochapterlevel command that sets the
sectioning level to chapter for book-like document
classes and to section for article-like ones. This
allows switching back and forth between such document
classes, again without having to adapt the sectioning
commands.

\levelup and \leveldown accept an optional parameter.
So \leveldown[2] at section level will change to
subsubsection, just as if \leveldown\leveldown had
been used.

There is also an asection environment in case you prefer
\begin{asection} \end{asection} instead of loose \leveldown
\levelup commands. The two types can even be mixed although
divine punishment will probably occur.

This package uses ideas and code from answers to this
question on Stackoverflow which I found when I was fed up
from having to change my sectioning commands all the time
due to constant restructuring of my text.
